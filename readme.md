## OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING - STATIC - PROTECTED - PRIVATE

In programming, we use special words called "access modifiers" to control who or what is able to use certain parts of our code. There are three main access modifiers: "static," "protected," and "private."

"Static" means that something belongs to a whole group of things, rather than just one thing. For example, if we have a group of dogs and one of them has a ball, the ball is "static" because it belongs to the group of dogs and not just one individual dog.

"Protected" means that something can only be used or seen by certain people or things. For example, if we have a class for dogs and a class for puppies, we might make some things "protected" in the dog class so that the puppies can use them too.

"Private" means that something can only be used or seen by one person or thing. For example, if we have a class for dogs and each dog has its own special name, we might make the name "private" so that only the dog itself can use its own name. This way, other people or things can't accidentally change the dog's name or use it for something else.
